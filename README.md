# Bubble: a no-code platform
I have heard about [Bubble](https://bubble.io/), a no-code platform that allows users to build web applications without needing to write code. I find it quite interesting because, with this platform, users can create fully functional web apps by dragging and dropping elements onto a visual editor and defining workflows for how the app should behave. It is a great tool for entrepreneurs, small businesses, and non-technical users to quickly build simple to moderately complex applications in a cost-efficient manner. 
However, I believe there are some issues or disadvantages to such no-code platforms. 
- They cannot offer the full flexibility or support the highly specific or complex functionality of traditional coding. 
- There are security concerns because users do not have control over the codebase or infrastructure. 
- For scalable applications, these platforms might not be as efficient or cost-effective.
